# 📘 Epigenomics-Analysis-Notebook


A curated and well-documented notebook for best-practice **bioinformatics analysis of epigenomics data**. This resource is designed to serve as both a **pipeline** and a **tutorial** for epigenomics labs working with high-throughput chromatin profiling technologies, including:

- **ATAC-seq**
- **ChIP-seq**
- **CUT&RUN**
- **CUT&TAG**

Many of the core methods are implemented in **R**, with support from complementary **Python** tools.

---

## 🧬 Purpose

This repository provides standardized, reproducible workflows and hands-on notebooks for:

- Preprocessing and quality control  
- Peak calling and annotation  
- Differential analysis and visualization  
- Data integration and interpretation  

It is intended to **train lab members**, **standardize lab protocols**, and **support new project development** in epigenomic profiling.
